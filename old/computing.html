					<div class="content">
						<p>The newest version of Aladin (v6.0) uses SAMP to communicate with other VO tools, such as Topcat. If you used Topcat and Aladin before (with PLASTIC), you were able to click on an object in Topcat and transmit it to Aladin which would load up an image of the field as well as Simbad and NED catalogs of the region. With version 6.0 that is no longer available- Aladin receives the coordinates, but does not load up an image.
                        <br>To work around this I have created a brief python code (which you can get <a href="../files/aladinvo.py">here</a>, requires <a href="http://cosmos.iasf-milano.inaf.it/pandora/sampy.html">SAMPy</a>). This needs to be executable and in your PATH. You then need to add a synthetic column in your Topcat table, something like: <i>concat("aladinvo.py ",toString(ucd$pos_eq_ra_main)," ",toString(ucd$pos_eq_dec_main))</i> and call it something like runme. Then, click the button beside Activation Action on the main screen and choose Execute Custom Code. The Executable Expression you want is <i>exec(runme)</i>, where runme is the name of the new column you created.
                        <br>Feel free to edit the code as you wish. I'm sure that a better job can be made with java and linking it directly to Topcat, but this is just intended as a quick and dirty solution. NOTE: This will only work if you call topcat from the command line.

						<h4>Proper Motions with geomap</h4>

						<p>To determine proper motions, you need to find out how much an object has moved from one 
						image to another. The task <b>geomap</b> allows you to "compute one or more spatial transformation 
						functions." What this means is that if you use a group of stars in a field to compute the 
						transformation function, one (hopefully your target) will behave differently. The offset of this 
						star with respect to the background stars will allow you to determine a proper motion.</p>
						
						<p>First, construct your target list. Use <b>display</b> to see the image. Start up 
						<b>imexamine</b>. You'll want to write out to a logfile (<i>:logfile NAME</i> and then <i>w</i> 
						to activate it). When pointing at a star, use <i>a</i> to get the centroid for the star (along 
						with some quick photometry). You can use <i>r</i> to examine the radial profile; be sure to pick 
						plenty of stars besides your target and check that they have normal-looking radial profiles. 
						I've heard <b>center</b> (in <b>noao.digiphot.apphot</b>) will do a similar thing plus 
						provide centroid errors.</p>
						
						<p>Your logfile should now have X, Y coordinates along with extra information, which you don't 
						particularly need. Use <b>tproject</b> (in <b>tables.ttools</b>) to extract out only the first 
						two columns (for example, <i>tproject NAME geo.coo c1,c2</i>).</p>
						
						<p>You now have only the X and Y coordinates for your image, repeat for all the images you have. 
						I haven't personally tried this, but you may be able to create a cursor file to execute the 
						commands within <b>imexamine</b> in the same order as before. You may want to check your objects 
						using like <i>tvmark 1 geo.coo mark=circle radii=3 color=205</i>. This will create circles around 
						the image displayed in frame 1.</p>
						
						<div class="right_image"><a href="../images/geomap.jpeg"><img src="../images/geomap.jpeg" width=230></a><br>
							A sreenshot of geomap
						</div>						
						
						<p>Now you want to create a file with the X,Y coordinates of one epoch and the X,Y coordinates 
						of your second epoch. The fastest way to do so is with <b>tjoin</b>. A command like 
						<i>tjoin geo1_1.coo geo2_1.coo geo_1.coo row row</i> will produce a file (geo_1.coo) with 
						4 columns: X1 Y1 X2 Y2 in just the right format for geomap. I've heard <b>xyxymatch</b> will 
						do a similar thing without having to worry about whether the coordinates are in the same
						order, but I personally haven't tried it.</p>
						
						<p>You're now ready to call <b>geomap</b> with something like 
						<i>geomap geo_1.coo geodata 1. 530. 1. 530.</i> (your xmin, etc. will probably be different).
						You'll see a plot that should look like your field. You may want to review the available 
						commands with ?. Produce the best fit you can (check the residuals) and be 
						sure to remove your target from it.</p>
						
						<p>Now you have your transform, but you still need the shifts for your star. You'll now 
						use <b>geoxytran</b> to determine this. The call is something like 
						<i>geoxytran geo_1.coo transformed geodata geo_1.coo</i> which will produce a file with 
						four columns: Xfit Yfit X2 Y2. By subracting the fit and actual values for your star you'll 
						be able to determine the pixel shifts in x and y.</p>
						
						<p>With the pixel shifts, plate scale, and orientation, you should be able to determine 
						shifts in RA and DEC in whatever units you desire. Your task is now complete.<br>
						I'll be updating this information if I try out any improved or timesaving techniques.</p>
