					<p>Here are some of my favorite hobbies, alphabetically:</p>
					
					<h4>Anime</h4>
					<p>Anime is Japanese animation. It's not just some fancy cartoons, it's an art form.
					Anime deals with all genres and topics. Some deal with complicated and ethical issues, while 
					others are just pure fun.
					<br>Among my favorite anime are <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>, often considered the greatest anime 
					of all time; <i>Death Note</i> and <i>Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion</i>, both of which 
					deal with anti-hero protagonists; <i>Inuyasha</i>, <i>Naruto</i>, and <i>Bleach</i> are fun 
					and action packed, but they are long running shows (100+ episodes) so keep that in mind.
					<br>Naturally, I can't list all the anime I've watched and recommend, but if you're 
					interested go to one of the many <a href="http://www.anime-planet.com/">anime sites</a> 
					out there.</p>
					
					<h4>Literature</h4>
					<p>I enjoy reading (and perhaps soon writing?) science fiction and fantasy. Some may say this is 
					escaping reality, but as C.S. Lewis once said: 'Who are the people most opposed to escapism? 
					Jailors!' There's nothing wrong with having a vivid imagination (unless, of course, your imagination 
					physically manifests itself- see <i>Sphere</i> by Michael Crichton).
					<br>Some of my favorite science fiction works are <i>Dune</i> by Frank Herbert, <i>Rendezvous with 
					Rama</i> by Arthur C. Clarke and <i>Foundation</i> by Isaac Asimov.
					For fantasy, I've enjoyed <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien, 
					<i>The Wheel of Time</i> by Robert Jordan, and <i>Mistborn</i> by Brandon Sanderson, among several others.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Video Games</h4>
					<p>While it's great to watch samurai slashing their foes or wizards invoking magic, it's always 
					best to try it out yourself. You may be hesitant to join a dojo and may have trouble finding a 
					school for the arcane arts, but that's where video games come to the rescue.
					<br>My favorite types of games are role-playing games (RPGs) and strategy. Some of my favorite RPGs 
					are the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series of games (particulary 6 and 10), 
					<i>Xenogears</i>, <i>Chrono Trigger</i>, <i>Baldur's Gate</i>, etc. I've also played some 
					MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online RPGs) and my favorite is <i>Ragnarok Online</i>. 
					Unfortunately, MMORPGs take a lot of time and effort so it's been a while.
					<br>For strategy games I tend to like some of the city-building type games, such as <i>SimCity</i>, 
					<i>Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom</i>, and <i>Spore</i>. I also enjoy some war games like 
					<i>Total Annihilation</i> and <i>Warcraft</i>.
